# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, edit, complete, delete, and filter tasks. Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage to persist even after the page is reloaded. The app also includes a feature to add notes to each task for extra context or reminders.

## Features
Add Task: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.

Edit Task: Tasks can be edited by the user.

Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, which strikes through the task and changes its status.

Delete Task: Tasks can be deleted individually.

Clear All Tasks: Users can clear all tasks from the list.

Filter Tasks: Users can filter tasks by their status: All, Pending, or Completed.

Responsive Design: The app is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the to-do list.

CSS: Styling the to-do list and making it mobile-responsive.

JavaScript: Adding interactivity (add, edit, delete, complete tasks, etc.) and localStorage functionality to persist tasks.
